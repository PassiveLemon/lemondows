Windows setup scripts. </br>

Don't expect anything out of these. Currently, I actually do not know if the scripts work as I have not tested them yet :) </br>

Lemon was when I mained Windows which I don't use anymore so I probably won't touch that. It's here for organizational purposes. I do use a Windows gaming dual-boot though so I have a setup for that with minimal extra packages. </br>
